#  Exercise — Component Refactoring & Props

This exercise focused on **thinking modularly** — taking a single, large component and breaking it down into smaller, reusable pieces.

## What I Learned

- **Modular thinking:**  
  Instead of keeping all logic and markup inside one big component (`App`), I learned to separate it into smaller components like `Header`, `Content`, `Part`, and `Total`.  
  Each one handles a specific responsibility — a key principle in React and clean code design.

- **Passing data with props:**  
  Discovered how to share information between components through **props**, which flow from parent to child.  
  This clarified how data moves in React apps and how each component renders based on what it receives.

- **Render hierarchy:**  
  Understood that rendering happens in a **top-down hierarchy** — the parent (`App`) controls what children render by passing data.  
  This mental model made React’s re-render logic start to make sense.

##  Personal Reflection
I learnt to  **structured components that communicate** by 
breaking things down modularly making it more logical
