# Introduction to React â€” Full Stack Open (Part 1)

This section marks my hands-on experience with **React**, where I learnt how modern web apps use **JavaScript logic** to dynamically render content.

---

##  What I Learned

- **Project setup with Vite:**  
  I initialized my first React app using Vite â€” a faster, modern alternative to Create React App.  
  It gave me an immediate look at how modular React projects are structured.

- **Rendering with JavaScript instead of HTML:**  
  Instead of editing the HTML file directly, I learned that React uses **JavaScript functions** and **JSX** to render elements into the DOM.

- **JSX syntax and dynamic values:**  
  Discovered that curly braces `{}` let you insert **JavaScript expressions** directly into JSX.

- **Using the browser console:**  
  Observing how React components run and re-render through the console helped me understand what happens under the hood.


- **Props and data flow:**  
  Learned how to pass data from parent to child components using **props** 

- **Avoid rendering objects directly:**  
  React cannot render objects to the DOM. I learned to instead display their **specific fields or map over arrays** when necessary.
